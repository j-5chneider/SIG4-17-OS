## Examples of good practices

::: {.panel-tabset .smaller09}

### Findable

**The problem:**  
Just because we provide data online, doesn't mean that others will find it.  
  
We could have the greatest data set to answer further research questions - if our colleagues don't know it exists or can't locate the data, openness will be of little value.
  

**The solutions:**

* Get a persistent identifier (e.g., DOI), where you provided your data
  - search for a research data center that fits your needs: [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/)
  - recommended research data centers: [Verbund FDB (education, Germany)](https://www.forschungsdaten-bildung.de/), [RDC at ZPID (psychology, Germany)](https://rdc-psychology.org/), ...
  - recommended repositories: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [psycharchives.org](https://www.psycharchives.org/), [osf.io](https://osf.io/), ... 
* Mention DOI in publication that builds on this data (e.g., in the "data accessibility statement")
* Describe your data as richly as possible (metadata). *Research data centers* offer form fields tailored to the discipline or data type. With *repositories* use alternative possibilities, such as keyword fields.
  - e.g., which variables does the quantitative data set contain?
  - e.g., which topics does your data cover?
  - e.g., which population did you draw your sample from?

### Accessible

**The problem:**  
Just because others find our data doesn't mean the *access barriers* are as low as possible and doesn't mean they know *in which way* they are allowed to access it. Examples:

* Providing a link to the data in the text of a paywalled journal article
* Unclear licensing / use conditions when providing data (e.g., are non-researchers allowed to access the data or is it only open for qualified researchers?)

**The solutions:**

* Make sure access is free of charge (or as cheap as possible)
  - e.g., by providing link to data in publicly accessible sections of journal articles that are not open access
  - e.g., by using repositories or research data centers that allow access free of charge
* Make sure users know if they can access and under which conditions
  - e.g., *research data centers* ensure that terms of use are clear (who may access under what conditions) and offer different levels of access restriction
  - e.g., on *repositories* provide a readme-file and an open license (e.g., [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.de)) with data sets for access cases


### Interoperable

**The problem:**  
Just because others downloaded our data doesn't mean they can open and manipulate it.

**The solutions:**  

* Use file formats with open licenses
  - e.g., tabular data: CSV (with additional labelling script), RData
  - e.g., text data: PDF, HTML, ODT, RTF
* Make sure users know how different files are related to one another
  - e.g., define which file contains student data and which teacher data
  - e.g., define which file contains data from cohort 1 and which cohort 2, ...

### Reusable

**The problem:**  
Just because others opened our data doesn't mean they understand the data and its use-conditions. Examples:

* Others can't understand what the column names of the tabular data set mean: Which columns in the data set relate to which variables in the journal article?
* Can someone from sociology use the data set from psychology they found on osf.io?
* Does someone reusing a data set have to cite the authors?

**The solutions:**  

* Adhere to standards in folder organization
  - e.g., [PSYCH-DS](https://psych-ds.github.io/) (see technical specification draft)
* Rich description/explanation of what user will find *in* the data set (≠ meta descriptions about the data set *as a whole*, as for accessibility)
  - e.g., provide a codebook. How to semi-automatically create a codebook, see the R package [`codebook`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codebook/readme/README.html)
* Provide a license for the use-cases
  - again, *research data centers* ensure that terms of use are clear (who may use under what conditions)
  - again, on *repositories* provide a readme-file and an open license (e.g., [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de), [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.de)) with data sets for the use-cases

## Examples of good practices
\

### tldr;

*What typical data sharing might look like:*

```{r}
fair_tbl <- data.frame(ToDo = c("<b>describe</b> what's in the data", "<b>share</b> via repository/ research data center (rdc) <br />that offers DOI", "<b>connect</b> DOI with paper"),
                       `Tools/Options` = c("<b>quantitative:</b> Create codebook via <a href='https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/articles/codebook_tutorial.html'>codebook R package</a><br /><b>qualitative:</b> provide methods and/or field report",
                                           "&#127466;&#127482; <a href='https://zenodo.org/'>Zenodo</a> (repository; option: visibility restricted)<br />&#127482;&#127480; <a href='https://osf.io/'>OSF</a> (repository; option: project private)<br />&#127482;&#127480; <a href='https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/'>Open ICPSR</a> (rdc)<br />&#127468;&#127463; <a href='https://www.data-archive.ac.uk/'>UK Data Archive</a> (rdc)<br />&#127465;&#127466; <a href='https://www.forschungsdaten-bildung.de/'>VerbundFDB</a> (rdc)",
                                           "put in section 'data availability', 'open practices', <br />'supplemental material', ..."))

fair_tbl %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_material(c("striped"))
```



## Examples of good practices

* Example of publication with **FAIR open data**: 
   - paper: <https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.230595> (link to data in section "Data accessibility")
   - open data: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7886776>
   - codebook in same repo<br /><br />
* Example of publication with **synthetic FAIR data**: 
   - paper: <https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-023-09460-4> (link to data in section "Data Availability")
   - synthetic data: <https://osf.io/qkr9a/>
   - codebook: <https://osf.io/wced4><br /><br />
* Example of publication with synthetic **FAIR data with restricted access**: 
   - paper: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2024.105542> (link to data in section "Transparency and openness")
   - restricted data: <https://doi.org/10.7802/2330> (curated at a research data center)
   - codebook available after login
   
## Open and Reproducible Code {.splash-slide}

## Why Reproducibility?

* Every analysis has "inductive bias"  [@Sterkenburg.Grunwald.2021]
    + What we learn from the data depends, in part, on how we analyze it
* Implicit steps in the analysis make inductive bias *intractable* [@Peikert.2023]
    + We don't know how, or how much, they influenced our results
* *Reproducibility* makes inductive bias tractable
* Reproducible code enables quantifying and studying inductive bias
* Ideally, your whole analysis is a sealed "pipeline": data in, results out
* Multiverse analysis: conducting a study of the impact of all "reasonable" analysis decisions on the estimand/conclusion [@Steegen.etal.2016]
* Reproducibility -> Scalability
    + Apply same method in new study
    + Redo analysis when new data come in
    + Incorporate analysis into application for stakeholders, etc


## Reproducibility is Challenging

#### Where do you start?

#### What tools do you need to learn?

#### What workflow is right for you?

## Introducing WORCS

### **W**orkflow for **O**pen **R**eproducible **C**ode in **S**cience

- Standardized workflow
- Low threshold, high ceiling
- Conceptual platform-independent principles: https://psyarxiv.com/k4wde
- "One-click" solution for R-users: https://cran.r-project.org/package=worcs
- Defaults based on best practices (several experts contributed)
- Compatible with journal/university requirements and other workflows
- Pulling down the learning curve!

![learningcurve](images/learningcurve.svg)


## The tools

### 1. Dynamic document generation
### 2. Version control
### 3. Dependency management



## 1. Dynamic document generation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- Paper consists of **text and code**
- Results, figures, and tables automatically generated
- Formatted as APA paper (including citations!)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

```{r out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/hex-rmarkdown.png")
```


:::

::::


### Important because:

- Save time from copy-pasting output and formatting paper
- Eliminate human error in copying results;
- When revising the paper, **all** results are automatically updated;
- Reproducible by default: Just generate the document


## R Markdown example

![rmarkdown](images/rmarkdown_example.png)



## R Markdown example rendered

![data-analysis](images/markdown_analysis.png)
![citation](images/markdown_citation.png)


## 2. Version control (using Git)

### Why version control?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- NO MORE manuscript_final_final_SERIOUSLYFINAL.doc

- "Track Changes" on steroids: record entire project history

- If something breaks, you can figure out what happened.

- Facilitates collaboration and experimentation!
:::



::: {.column width="30%"}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif")
```

:::

::::



## 2. Version control (using Git)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


```{r, out.width="50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/play-changes.svg")
```

Tracks changes to (text-based) files line by line:

* _add_ files to your repository
* _commit_ changes to these files
* _push_ all commits to remote repository (private backup or public online supplement)

:::



::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, out.width="50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git-staging-area.svg")
```

One command in `worcs`: `git_update("Describe your changes")`
:::

## Introducing GitHub

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

- `worcs` repository is backed up in a remote repository like [GitHub](https://github.com/);

- GitHub is a **"cloud backup"** with **"social networking"** features
    + Clone other people's repository to reproduce or build upon them
    + Open Issues with questions or comments about the work
    + Send suggested changes as a "Pull request"

- GitHub can be used to 'tag' specific states of the repository, e.g. a preregistration.
]

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

![](images/preregistration.png)

:::

::::




## Important because:

- Complete backup of entire project history
    * Go back to previous version if you want
    * Try new things, don't worry about losing work
    * Prove that you preregistered your plans and followed them
- Easy collaboration online (even with strangers)
    * People can copy your project and build on it
- GitHub can be your preregistration, your research archive, supplementary materials, comments section, etc.
- Connects to OSF.io project page
    * Improves **F**indability
    * Get DOI for project and/or specific resources
- Connects to Zenodo
    * Get DOI for project and/or specific resources
    * Store project snapshot


## 3. Dependency management

- To make project reproducible, people must have access to your (exact) **software dependencies**
    * For R-users, these are `R-packages`

- Difficult trade-off:

![](images/dependencytradeoff.svg)


## Dependency management in WORCS

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}



- Maintains text-based list of packages, their version,  
  and origin (e.g., “CRAN”, “Bioconductor”, “GitHub”)
- This list can be version-controlled with Git;
- When a user loads the project,  
    `renv` installs all dependencies from the list

### Important because:

- Essential for reproducibility
- Good for collaboration (everybody has same versions)
- Nice to your "future self": Your code will work in the future

<!-- With the background knowledge in mind, let's have another look at the workflow -->

## Unique features in `worcs`

* RStudio template
* Automatic installation check: `check_worcs_installation()`
* Easy GitHub integration
    - Add URL during project creation
    - `git_update("Commit message")`
    - Automatically reproduce results in the cloud!
* Manuscript and preregistration templates
    - From `rticles`, `papaja`, and `prereg`
    - Original templates for secondary- and longitudinal data
* Data sharing solutions
* Cite `@essential` and `@@nonessential`
* Integration with `targets`
* WORCS checklist and badge


## Sharing data in WORCS

- Reproducibility requires open data
- Some data may be (privacy) sensitive
    * E.g., children's data, veterans' data, patient data

#### Use `open_data()`:

- Original data made public
- Default is a `.csv` (text based, human / machine readable)
- Other save / load functions can be used

#### Use `closed_data()`:

- Original data saved locally;
- Synthetic data created using `synthetic()`
- Synthetic data made public (default: `.csv`)
- Unique ID of original data made public (so people can audit your work)


## Sharing data in WORCS

#### Loading data `load_data()`:

- **If** original data are present, load them...
- ...**Else**, load synthetic data
- Scripts can thus ALWAYS be reproduced
- People can create a working script using synthetic data, and send it to you to run on original data
- Load function recorded in `.worcs` file; default `read.csv()`


## Reproducing WORCS Project

1. Create entry point (e.g., `manuscript.Rmd`)
2. Define recipe (e.g., `rmarkdown::render("manuscript.Rmd")`)
3. Snapshot endpoints recipe (e.g., `manuscript.pdf`, `table1.csv`)

`worcs::reproduce()` generates the endpoints from the entry point via the recipe

`worcs::check_endpoints()` verifies that the results are identical


## Continuous Integration

Run `worcs::reproduce()` on GitHub via GitHub Actions

![](images/action_reproduce.png)


## `targets` Integration

Targets creates a pipeline for computationally intensive workflows

* Each step is only re-run if:
    + The step changed
    + Its inputs changed
  
This is perfectly compatible with `worcs`!

## Using `targets`

* Select "Use `targets`" when creating a WORCS project
* Use `worcs::add_targets()`
* Select "Target Markdown" as output format

A `targets` workflow is executed by running `targets::tar_make()`

* `worcs` sets the recipe to `targets::tar_make()`, so `worcs::reproduce()` runs it
* `worcs` makes sure that the last step of the pipeline is to render an Rmarkdown to report the results



## For non-R-users

* WORCS-paper addresses the **conceptual** workflow
* Covers issues/decisions you have to consider for Open Science, regardless of software
* `worcs` is a good starting point for new R-users
    + Setup Tutorial to help install everything
    + Tricky issues (like project management and using Git) are ~automatic when using the WORCS template
    + Automatic check in case you get stuck: `check_worcs_installation()`
* Learn good habits from the start; don't reinvent the wheel
